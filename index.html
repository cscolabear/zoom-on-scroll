                <p>
                    China has concealed the extent of the coronavirus outbreak in its country, under-reporting both
                    total cases and deaths it’s suffered from the disease, the U.S. intelligence community concluded
                    in
                    a classified report to the White House, according to three U.S. officials.<br>

                    The officials asked not to be identified because the report is secret, and they declined to
                    detail
                    its contents. But the thrust, they said, is that China’s public reporting on cases and deaths is
                    intentionally incomplete. Two of the officials said the report concludes that China’s numbers
                    are
                    fake.<br>

                    The report was received by the White House last week, one of the officials said.

                    The outbreak began in China’s Hubei province in late 2019, but the country has publicly reported
                    only
                    about 82,000 cases and 3,300 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.
                    That
                    compares to more than 189,000 cases and more than 4,000 deaths in the U.S., which has the
                    largest
                    publicly reported outbreak in the world.

                U.S. President Donald Trump said Wednesday that China’s reported virus data appear to be on the
                "light
                side" but that he hadn’t received an intelligence report saying the country had concealed the
                extent of
                its outbreak.<br>

                "Their numbers seem to be a little bit on the light side, and I’m being nice when I say that,"
                he said
                at a daily coronavirus briefing at the White House.
            </p>
            <p>
                Trump added that the U.S. and China were in constant communication and that Beijing would spend
                $250 billion to purchase American products. "We’d like to keep it, they’d like to keep it" he
                said of the U.S.-China trade deal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Communications staff at the White House and the Chinese embassy in Washington didn’t immediately
                respond to requests for comment.

                    “The reality is that we could have been better off if China had been more forthcoming,” Vice
                    President Mike Pence said Wednesday on CNN. “What appears evident now is that long before the
                    world learned in December that China was dealing with this, and maybe as much as a month earlier
                    than that, that the outbreak was real in China.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While China eventually imposed a strict lockdown beyond those of less autocratic nations, there
                    has been considerable skepticism toward China’s reported numbers, both outside and within the
                    country. The Chinese government has repeatedly revised its methodology for counting cases, for
                    weeks excluding people without symptoms entirely, and only on Tuesday added more than 1,500
                    asymptomatic cases to its total.

                <p>Stacks of thousands of urns outside funeral homes in Hubei province have driven public doubt in
                    Beijing’s reporting.
                </p>
                <p>Republican lawmakers in the U.S. have been particularly harsh about China’s role in the outbreak.
                    Enhancing Beijing’s role in the pandemic could be politically helpful to Trump, who has sought to
                    shift blame for the U.S. outbreak away from his administration’s delays in achieving widespread
                    testing for the virus and mobilizing greater production of supplies such as face masks and hospital
                    ventilators.

                    “The claim that the United States has more coronavirus deaths than China is false,” Senator Ben
                    Sasse, a Nebraska Republican, said in a statement after Bloomberg News published its report.
                    “Without commenting on any classified information, this much is painfully obvious: The Chinese
                    Communist Party has lied, is lying, and will continue to lie about coronavirus to protect the
                    regime.”
                </p>
                <p>Deborah Birx, the State Department immunologist advising the White House on its response to the outbreak, said Tuesday that China’s public reporting influenced assumptions elsewhere in the world about the nature of the virus.
